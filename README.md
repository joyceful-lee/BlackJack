# Simple BlackJack Player

This project emulates a single player vs. a dealer for BlackJack. You can bet chips, stay, and hit (the basic features).
It's not the fanciest, but it does the job.

## How To Play
After running, input how much money you want to start with in the pop-up.
Next, press the chips you want to use as a bet and press "Done Bet" to start the game.
You'll be dealt cards and you can choose whether to "Hit" or "Stay."
Whether you win or loose, you can choose to play again with the money you have lost or gained.
(If you want to change your money amount, you need to rerun).

## Credits
I made the chips myself - if you want to download and use them, go ahead.
I got the cards from the [Google Code Archive] (https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/downloads).
The graphic for the dealer chips is absolutely useless (so pretend it's not there)
